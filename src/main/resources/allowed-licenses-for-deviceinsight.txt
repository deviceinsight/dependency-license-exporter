#
# The following licenses have a weak copyleft restriction. Therefore we only need to disclose our source code, when we:
# - modify the library’s source code
# - copy the library’s source code into our application code
# - statically link the library (some libraries allow this)
#
# You can use a library licensed under one of the following licenses, as long as you follow the above rules.
# An approved approach is using the library as maven dependency.
